## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Expand Existing + Core New (Target: 150 devices)

| Vendor            | Devices | Priority  |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Ubiquiti (expand) | +40     | Immediate |
| MikroTik (expand) | +35     | Immediate |

| APC (new)         | 13      | Immediate |
| Dell PowerEdge    | 15      | Immediate |
| Supermicro        | 10      | Immediate |
| HPE Aruba         | 15      | Week 2    |

### Phase 2: Budget Networking (Target: +50 devices)

| Vendor     | Devices | Priority           |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| CyberPower | 10      | High (need images) |
| QNAP       | 12      | Medium             |
| TP-Link    | 8       | Medium             |

| Netgear    | 10      | Low                |

### Image Sourcing Strategy

| Status              | Devices | Action                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| Has images          | ~150    | Direct import               |
| Missing images      | ~200    | Source from vendor sites    |
| No images available | ~50     | Create generic placeholders |

### Image Naming Convention

- Front: `<slug>.front.png`
- Rear: `<slug>.rear.png`

### Known Gaps

1. **HPE ProLiant servers** - Not in repository (networking only)
2. **CyberPower images** - Zero coverage
3. **Popular Dell models** - R710, R730, R740 lack images
4. **MikroTik CRS series** - Many switches missing images

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Create implementation issue (#97) sub-tasks per vendor
2. [ ] Begin Phase 1 implementation with Ubiquiti expansion
3. [ ] Source missing images from vendor documentation
4. [ ] Set up automated import pipeline from NetBox YAML
